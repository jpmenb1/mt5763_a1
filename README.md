This project is an analysis of chemical composition of cannabis plants in different soil types. 

Its aim was to answe three questions:
-Do the data indicate differences in the elemental composition of the cannabis leaves grown in different soil types?
-Are some of the elements related to one another in terms of their levels in the sample leaves?
-Is it possible to determine what soil these plants were grown in, based solely on the elemental composition of the cannabis leaves?
